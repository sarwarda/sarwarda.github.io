									 		<blockquote> Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) has oncogenic and tumor suppressor roles in cancer. There is clinical success of targeting this complex in PRC2-dependent cancers, but an unmet therapeutic need exists in PRC2-loss cancer. PRC2 inactivating mutations are a hallmark feature of high-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), an aggressive sarcoma with poor prognosis and no effective targeted therapy. Through RNAi screening in MPNST, we found that PRC2-inactivation increases sensitivity to genetic or small molecule inhibition of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), which results in enhanced cytotoxicity and antitumor response. Mechanistically, PRC2 inactivation amplifies DNMT inhibitor (DNMTi) mediated expression of retrotransposons, subsequent viral mimicry response, and robust cell death in part through PKR-dependent double stranded-RNA (dsRNA) sensor. Collectively, our observations posit DNA methylation as a safeguard against anti-tumorigenic cell fate decisions in PRC2-loss cancer to promote cancer pathogenesis, which can be therapeutically exploited by DNMT1 targeted therapy. </blockquote>

											<blockquote> Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has demonstrated clinical success in “inflamed” tumors with substantial T-cell infiltrates, but tumors with an immune-desert tumor microenvironment (TME) fail to benefit. The tumor cell-intrinsic molecular mechanisms of the immune-desert phenotype remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that inactivation of the Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) core components, EED or SUZ12, a prevalent genetic event in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) and sporadically in other cancers, drove a context-dependent immune-desert TME. PRC2 inactivation reprogramed the chromatin landscape that led to a cell-autonomous shift from primed baseline signaling-dependent cellular responses (e.g., interferon γ) to PRC2-regulated development and cellular differentiation transcriptional programs. Further, PRC2 inactivation led to diminished tumor immune infiltrates through reduced chemokine production and impaired antigen presentation and T-cell priming, resulting in primary resistance to ICB. Intratumoral delivery of inactivated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) enhanced tumor immune infiltrates and sensitized PRC2-loss tumors to ICB. Our results provide molecular mechanisms of PRC2-inactivation-mediated context-dependent epigenetic reprogramming that underline the immune-desert phenotype in cancer. Our studies also point to intratumoral delivery of immunogenic viruses as an initial therapeutic strategy to modulate the immune-desert TME and capitalize on the clinical benefit of ICB.</blockquote>

												 <blockquote> Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a highly aggressive subtype of soft-tissue sarcoma with a high propensity to metastasize and extremely limited treatment options. Loss of the RAS-GAP NF1 leads to sustained RAF/MEK/ERK signaling in MPNST. However, single-agent MEK inhibitors (MEKi) have failed to elicit a sustained inhibition of the MAPK signaling pathway in MPNST. We used pharmacological, biochemical, and genetic perturbations of the receptor tyrosine kinase and MAPK signaling pathway regulators to investigate the mechanisms of MEKi resistance and evaluated combination therapeutic strategies in various preclinical MPNST models in vitro and in vivo. Here, we report that MEKi treatment resistance in MPNST involves two adaptive pathways: direct transcriptional upregulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase PDGFRβ and MEKi-induced increase in RAF dimer formation and activation of downstream signaling. Although the pharmacologic combination of a MEKi with a PDGFRβ-specific inhibitor was more effective than treatment with the MEKi alone, the combination of the MEKi and RAF dimer inhibitors led to a robust inhibition of MAPK pathway signaling. This combination treatment was effective in vitro and in vivo, as demonstrated by the significant increase in drug synergism and its high effectiveness in decreasing MPNST viability. Our findings suggest that the combination of MEKis and PDGFR and/or RAF dimer inhibitors can overcome MEKi resistance and may serve as a novel targeted therapeutic strategy for patients with NF1-deficient MPNST, which in turn could impact future clinical investigations for this patient population.</blockquote>

												 <blockquote> Members of the KMT2C/D–KDM6A complex are recurrently mutated in urothelial carcinoma and in histologically normal urothelium. Here, using genetically engineered mouse models, we demonstrate that Kmt2c/d knockout in the urothelium led to impaired differentiation, augmented responses to growth and inflammatory stimuli and sensitization to oncogenic transformation by carcinogen and oncogenes. Mechanistically, KMT2D localized to active enhancers and CpG-poor promoters that preferentially regulate the urothelial lineage program and Kmt2c/d knockout led to diminished H3K4me1, H3K27ac and nascent RNA transcription at these sites, which leads to impaired differentiation. Kmt2c/d knockout further led to KMT2A–menin redistribution from KMT2D localized enhancers to CpG-high and bivalent promoters, resulting in derepression of signal-induced immediate early genes. Therapeutically, Kmt2c/d knockout upregulated epidermal growth factor receptor signaling and conferred vulnerability to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors. Together, our data posit that functional loss of Kmt2c/d licenses a molecular ‘field effect’ priming histologically normal urothelium for oncogenic transformation and presents therapeutic vulnerabilities. </blockquote>

													 <blockquote> Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is widely recognized to arise from a “field” of precancerous but histologically normal urothelium (HNU). The molecular mechanism that licenses the “field effect” remains elusive. Recent studies revealed prevalent KMT2C and KMT2D loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in HNU and cancer adjacent urothelium, suggesting their potential involvement in UC initiation. Here, we demonstrated that knockout (KO) of Kmt2c and/or Kmt2d in murine urothelial cells induced drastic alterations of cellular states by single cell RNA analysis, but was insufficient to induce robust histological changes. Kmt2c/d loss enhanced organoid formation efficiency, induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and impaired urothelial differentiation, indicating the augmented lineage plasticity after Kmt2c/d KO. Additionally, we identified that Kmt2c/d KO induced a pre-tumorigenic transcriptome with increased enrichments of gene sets associated with inflammation and decreased enrichments of gene sets associated with differentiation. Consequently, loss of Kmt2c/d sensitized urothelial cells to common oncogenic mutations to initiate UC in mouse models. We further observed that KO of Kmt2c/d increased tumorigenic susceptibility in carcinogen-induced UC model. Mechanistically, we observed decreased H3K4me1, H3K27Ac histone marks and decreased enhancer RNA production at the majority of enhancers that correlate with downregulation of urothelial specific lineage gene expression after Kmt2c/d KO. Furthermore, we observed increased Menin deposition on promoters of up-regulated genes. Blockade of Menin-KMT2A complex by small molecule inhibitor partially rescued the EMT and basal differentiation induced by Kmt2c/d KO. Together, our data posit that Kmt2c/d represents a key molecular determinant and their functional loss licenses a molecular “field effect” which primes the urothelium for oncogenic transformation. </blockquote>
