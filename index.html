									<p><b>Welcome, I hope to give you a general overview of myself as well as access to some of my personal projects. 
										If you have any inquiries, you may reach out via email using the contact link below.</b></p>
									<p> Originally focused on wet-lab procedures, I am now a Data Analyst with a strong foundation in scientific terminology, clinical data handling, and real-world data applications. After completing a graduate certificate in Data Science at Johns Hopkins, I transitioned into the field by studying advanced statistics, data modeling, and machine learning. My approach emphasizes a deep understanding of datasets before applying analytical techniques or building predictive models.

										In 2023, I gained hands-on industry experience by contributing to a large-scale healthcare data project. This opportunity allowed me to work with complex datasets, support enterprise-level reporting, and collaborate with cross-functional teams—strengthening both my technical skills and understanding of data-driven decision-making in a real-world setting.
										
										Now, I’m focused on expanding my experience—particularly with APIs, deep learning applications, and enterprise data infrastructure. While my background is rooted in life sciences and medicine, I’m open to opportunities across industries that support continued growth in data science and analytics.
										
										Below, you’ll find recent personal projects. Feel free to reach out via email or GitHub with questions, feedback, or just to connect. Thank you!
										   </p>

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/sarwarda/predict-covid19-outcome">Predicting Covid-19 Patient Mortality<br />
										 via Logistic Regression</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Covid-19 resulted in millions of deaths during the pandemic, where patient mortality was 
										difficult to predict. Over time, we began to narrow down risk factors for poor patient outcomes to 
										help the public make educated decisions about their health and well-being. Although medical 
										professionals could narrow down risk factors, some patients without these risk factors died after 
										hospitalization unexpectedly. In addition, hospitals struggled with PPE, hospital beds, medicine, 
										staff, and various medical supplies. As a result, medical professionals would attempt to predict 
										patient outcomes based on research, personal experience, and patient symptoms to effectively 
										save as many lives as possible.  
										 
										The goal of this project is to build a logistic regression model and answer the question: 
										 
										What risk factors and diagnostic features can be used to classify patient outcomes as a 
										result of Covid-19, and can we use this model to predict patient death?</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Decision Tree Classifier and Dashboard for Breast Cancer Mortality<br />
											</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/sarwarda/breast-cancer-outcome" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Breast cancer is a common cancer found among women that can prove fatal if not detected early on. 
										The role of data science in the medical field is growing each year, where the ability to select 
										important features, make useful predictions, and classify data has allowed data scientists to 
										predict patient prognosis and determine the biggest risk factors for malignant tumorigenesis. 
										The data set selected is the Seer Breast Cancer Dataset, which consists of 4,024 patients 
										with infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma breast cancer. 
										
										The goal of this project is to create a dashboard(s) that allows users to visualize the most significant 
										predictors of patient status and make predictions about patient prognosis using machine learning techniques. 
										Specifically, this project will include a brief ETL/EDA stage as well as showcase two Tableau dashboards 
										that fulfill these goals.

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/sarwarda/housing_market_forecasting">Building a Forecast Model for the Housing Market<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>When we think of the housing market, most people assume home values go up over time which makes residential 
										properties a vital investment opportunity. Although this is essentially true, trends and seasonality play an 
										essential role in tracking and predicting housing prices at specific time points; 
										these forecasting factors can make a huge difference in month to month or year to year profits and growth. 
										The goal of this project is to perform a thorough ETL/EDA of the Redfin Housing Market data, followed by 
										several attempts to build an accurate forecasting model that takes these factors into consideration. </p>
